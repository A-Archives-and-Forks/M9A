# Custom Writing

Refer to the development method, currently it is [Option Two](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/docs/en_us/1.1-QuickStarted.md#approach-2-json--custom-logic-extension-recommended), where custom task modules are registered through AgentServer.

[The place where dreams begin](https://github.com/MAA1999/M9A/pull/371), here implements a simple task timeout screenshot, as well as the `logger` module.

The commonly used callable maafw interfaces can be directly viewed in other custom implementations in the project. For a deeper understanding, you can combine [Integration Interface Overview](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/docs/en_us/2.2-IntegratedInterfaceOverview.md) and [py binding source code](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/tree/main/source/binding/Python/maa) for understanding.
